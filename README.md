# MyfirstDatathon-MLClassification
Objective: to analyse the differences between churn customers and active customers of a bank and to train a system that is able to predict whether a customer has churned.

This project is based on the first datathon I took part in, it is from Kaggle. This project is an improvement on the initial one in which I participated.
